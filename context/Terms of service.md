## **About Bodhgriha**

Bodhgriha (“**Bodhgriha**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, “**us**”) is a yoga course and retreat aggregation platform operated by **Bodhgriha Technologies Private Limited**, a company incorporated under the laws of **India** and headquartered in **Goa, India**.  
 Across our web properties, the common purpose is to help users **discover, compare, and book** yoga courses, teacher-training programs, and retreats offered by independent schools and teachers (“**Organizers**”).

## **Support**

We care about a smooth experience. If you encounter issues while using our platform, contact **support@bodhgriha.com**. We will make reasonable efforts to assist you; however, such support is **courtesy-based** and **does not create any legal obligation** beyond what is stated in these Terms.

## **Terms of Use**

These Terms of Use (“**Terms**”) govern all access to and use of the Bodhgriha website(s), applications, and services (collectively, the “**Platform**”). We may **amend** these Terms at our discretion. By browsing, using the Platform, and/or submitting a booking request or reservation, you confirm that you have **read, understood, and agree** to these Terms. If you continue using the Platform after updates, you are deemed to have accepted the updated Terms. If you do not agree, you must cease use of the Platform.

### **3.1 General**

* Bodhgriha provides the Platform **“as is” and “as available.”**

* Use of the Platform is **at your own risk** and responsibility.

* We may implement technical and/or procedural changes or improvements at any time without liability to you.

*(In plain words: we continuously improve the Platform; please use it responsibly and at your own risk.)*

## **Using the Platform**

Through the Platform you can:

1. View Organizer listings (“**Offerings**”);  
2. Submit **non-binding** booking requests (“**Requests**”);  
3. Receive confirmations that create a **binding agreement** between **you and the Organizer** (“**Reservation**”);

### **4.1 Your Contract Is With the Organizer**

1. **Bodhgriha is not a party** to the agreement between you and any Organizer.  
2. Organizer-specific **terms, policies, and conditions** apply to each Offering and Reservation. **Read them carefully**; adhering to them is **your responsibility**.

### **4.2. Your Responsibilities**

1. Provide **accurate and complete information** when making a Reservation. To view, modify, or cancel, refer to your confirmation email and the Organizer’s terms.  
2. You are solely responsible for any content you submit (e.g., reviews). You warrant that your content is lawful, does not infringe third-party rights (IP, privacy, publicity, etc.), and does not promote illegal or harmful activity (e.g., hate speech, violence, weapons/drugs, or spam).
